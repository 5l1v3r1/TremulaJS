#TremulaJS

**Picture Streams + Momentum Engine + Bézier Paths + Silky Smooth Mojo**

##What it is
    
TremulaJS (trem-yoo-la) is a client-side javascript UI component providing Bézier-based content-stream interactions with momentum & physics effects for mouse, scroll and and touch UIs. 

**Put another way, TremulaJS can be thought of as an extremely bad-ass image carousel.**  

The TremulaJS project began as an exercise in reverse engineering Apple's momentum-scrolling for Javascript. More specifically, I wanted a component which would deliver silky smooth scrolling when used with a touch device, a mouse or an Apple trackpad.  The project eventually grew into a tool able to synthesize live visual content feeds into compelling path-based interactions.

TremulaJS was developed by Garris Shipon at Art.com Labs.
