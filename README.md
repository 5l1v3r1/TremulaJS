# TremulaJS

**Picture Streams + Momentum Engine + Bézier Paths + Cross-Browser + Cross-Device**  

TremulaJS (trem-yoo-la) is a client-side javascript UI component providing Bézier-based content-stream interactions with momentum & physics effects for mouse, scroll and and touch UIs. 

**Put another way, TremulaJS can be thought of as an extremely bad-ass image carousel.**

The TremulaJS project began as an exercise to create an Apple-style momentum-scroller for Javascript UI projects. The project eventually grew into a tool able to synthesize live visual content feeds into compelling path-based interactions.

TremulaJS was developed by [Garris Shipon](http://garriss.wordpress.com/) at [Art.com Labs](http://art.com/).
