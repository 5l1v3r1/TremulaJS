#TremulaJS

**Picture Streams + Bézier Paths + Momentum + CSS3**

##What it is...
    
TremulaJS (trem-yoo-la) is a client-side javascript UI component providing Bézier-based content-stream interactions with momentum & physics effects for pointer, scroll and and touch web apps. 

**Put another way, TremulaJS can be thought of as an extremely bad-ass image carousel.**  

The TremulaJS project began as an exercise in reverse engineering Apple's momentum-scrolling for Javascript. More specifically, I wanted a component which would perform silky smooth when used with a touch device, mouse and an Apple trackpad.  The project eventually grew into a tool able to synthesize live visual content feeds into compelling path-based interactions.
